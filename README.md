# Pre-work
Introductory website that includes a brief description of who I am, my LinkedIn and Github usernames, and my favorite song. This website was created using Javascript, HTML , and CSS. In addition to including a radio button, button, and javascript functionality for those buttons, the website also includes a spotify link that plays a song, for which the buttons ask related questions about the song itself (ie. "Did you like the song").
