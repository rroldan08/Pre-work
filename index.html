        Here's a little about me...
    </div>

    <div class="firstwordbunch">
    I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I'm a junior student at
    CalState LA majoring in Computer Science. I was originally
    interested in pursing a career in Journalism and was very humanities-oriented, but
    soon got into a STEM major once I realized I wouldn't be making as much in journalism.
    Did track and field in high school, and later began learning jiu-jitsu. Still try to keep
    active these days, and I hope that Portugal can be a good environment for that.
